# What led me here?
--

<img src="img/old_man.png" height="150px" align="left"/>

???
- Grew up in a small town in NH.

--

<img src="img/wp.png" height="150px" align="left"/>

???
- Went to West Point (first to graduate college in my family)

--

<img src="img/iz.png" height="150px" align="left"/>

???
- I have spent over four years deployed, working through long term planning with other cultures

--

???
- Went back to West Point to teach leadership- organizational emphasis on character development

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

???
- In the Child Study Human Development program- natural fit given project Arete
- Discussing research areas with Rich- Leadership, "what has made you successful", humility and self-regulation
- Started learning about ISR, and one day had a conversation with Hillary about risk "kind of being the opposite of ISR"
- I would consider myself to be good at goal-directed behavior...but am I also risky? maybe, maybe not...it depends.
- access to Cadets (well studied population)

- Describe in detail the jump example to set up the talk. Focus primarily on decision making (goal directed behavior), the many unknowns that exist making the decision very hard to do.

- Describe ISR- where it came from (German Action Theory), and why it is interesting (4H study)
- ISR is the coordinated integration of these three processes. 
- ISR itself is not enough to describe intraindividual differences between person A and person B...largely because of the "unknown", or never having 100% of the information. Use

- Define Classical Decision Making and how ISR (SOC) falls into this category for the most part.
- Define Naturalistic Decision Making and how context needs to be considered to understand why someone makes a decision.

Describe evolution of decision making from classical to naturalistic
- go back to how ISR is viewed (context general)
- may be a good way to describe context specific ISR

Describe nuances of risk-taking
- describe each of these four areas and how we're learning more about them...
